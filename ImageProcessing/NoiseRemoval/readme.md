### Analysis on noise removal algorithm

  * Unweighted Average
    * Advantage
      * linear operator
      * reduce noise
    * Disadvantage
      * blur the image

  * K-nearest Neighbour Averaging
   * Advantage
      * edge-preserving

  * Median Filtering
    * Advantage
      * remove noise while keeping sharpness of edges
    * Disadvantage
      * Nonlinear
      * Corners are lost
